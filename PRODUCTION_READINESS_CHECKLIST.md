  - ✅ Dynamic imports for less critical web pages
  - ✅ Suspense boundaries added for loading states
- [ ] **Image Optimization** - CDN setup
  - Use image CDN (e.g., Cloudinary, Imgix)
  - Implement responsive images
  - Lazy load images
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**
  - Implement service worker for offline support
  - Cache static assets
  - API response caching where appropriate

### Security Hardening
- [ ] **Rate Limiting** - API and auth endpoints

  - ✅ X-Frame-Options - Already configured
  - ✅ X-Content-Type-Options - Already configured
  - ✅ X-XSS-Protection - Already configured
  - ✅ Referrer-Policy - Already configured
  - ✅ Permissions-Policy - Already configured
- [ ] **Input Validation** - Review all user inputs
  - Sanitize user-generated content
  - Validate file uploads
  - Prevent SQL injection (already using parameterized queries)

### Operational
- [ ] **Backup Strategy** - Database backups
  - Automated daily backups
  - Backup retention policy
  - Test restore procedures
- [ ] **Disaster Recovery Plan** - Incident response
  - Document recovery procedures
  - Define rollback process
  - Communication plan for outages
- [x] **Environment Variables** - Document all required vars
  - ✅ Created `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` with comprehensive documentation
  - ✅ Documented each variable's purpose and where to get it
  - ✅ Included security best practices for secrets

### Documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation** - Document all Edge Functions
  - Request/response schemas
  - Authentication requirements
  - Error codes and messages
- [ ] **Deployment Guide** - Step-by-step deployment
  - Environment setup
  - Database migrations
  - Rollback procedures
- [ ] **Runbook** - Common operations
  - How to restart services
  - How to clear caches
  - How to run migrations

## 📊 Production Metrics to Monitor

### Critical Metrics
- **Error Rate** - Track `4xx` and `5xx` responses
- **Response Time** - API endpoint latency (p50, p95, p99)
- **Payment Success Rate** - Successful vs failed payments
- **Database Performance** - Query execution times, connection pool usage
- **Edge Function Performance** - Execution time, memory usage

### Business Metrics
- **Event Creation Rate** - New events per day
- **Ticket Sales** - Revenue, tickets sold per day
- **User Registration** - New users per day
- **Active Organizers** - Organizers with active events
- **Payment Processing** - Total transactions, success rate

## 🔍 Security Audit Points

### Before Launch

  - ✅ Audit document created (`docs/CONSOLE_LOG_AUDIT.md`)
  - ✅ DEBUG logs removed from production code
  - ✅ ProtectedRoute debug logs gated to development only
  - ✅ PDF generation debug logs removed
- [x] Verify no API keys in client-side code - ✅ Only `VITE_` prefixed variables (safe to expose) are used client-side
- [ ] Check all external API integrations use secure endpoints
- [ ] Verify HTTPS enforced everywhere
- [ ] Review database access patterns and RLS policies
- [ ] Test authentication flows (login, OTP, password reset)

### Post-Launch
- [ ] Regular security audits (quarterly)
