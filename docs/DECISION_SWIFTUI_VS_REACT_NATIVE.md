# Quick Decision Guide: SwiftUI vs React Native

## You Currently Have:
✅ SwiftUI project created in Xcode (`ticketrack-attendee`)

## The Question:
Do you want **iOS only** or **iOS + Android**?

### If iOS Only → Continue with SwiftUI
- You're already set up
- Native performance
- Swift language

### If iOS + Android → Switch to React Native/Expo
- One codebase for both platforms
- Reuse your React knowledge
- Faster development

## Recommendation for Ticketrack

Given that you:
- Already have a React web app
- Need to reach both iOS and Android users
- Want faster development

**I recommend React Native/Expo** because:
- ✅ Build once, deploy to both platforms
- ✅ Reuse patterns from your web app
- ✅ Supabase has excellent React Native support
- ✅ Your team likely knows React already

## What Do You Want to Do?

**A)** Continue with SwiftUI (iOS native) - I'll help set up Supabase and build iOS app
**B)** Switch to React Native/Expo (iOS + Android) - I'll help create Expo project
**C)** Need more information to decide

Let me know and I'll guide you through the setup!
